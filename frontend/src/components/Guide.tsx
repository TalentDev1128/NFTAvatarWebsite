          Last week, we started minting on the Bloot Elves. They were free to mint, with optional donations.
          <br />
          But right after release, we saw the contract was being exploited in unfair ways. Meaning, we had to do somethign about it.
          <br />
          So we paused minting and worked thoroughly on a solution to clean up the mess.
          <br />
          This solution is a migration from the elves from the old contract to the new contract.
          <br />
          All elves will come out on the other side with the same traits, except the exploited elves in the old contract, which will be re-generated.

          As a reward for migrating your elves, and specially for your patience, you will be airdropped a Zen Elf golden statue, one per elf you migrate.

          Keep your Zen Elf close to your heart as it is your passport for next instalments in the IGGYVERSE.

          Here's how to migrate your Elves:
          (if you have any questions or doubts, ask on Discord!!! discord.gg/kh4JXHkX34)
          <br />
          Note: if you don't delist your elf, it might be bought on the secondary market and someone else will migrate it and get a Zen Elf instead of you.
          <br />
          1- Go to the migration section (top menu) on the website blootelves.family
          <br />
          2- Press the first button to authorize the contract (needs to be done only once). Wait and once the transaction is approved, go to the next step.
          <br />
          3- Press the Burn and Migrate button. Your old elf will be burned and you will receive an identical one in your wallet (you can see it in the Mint section).
          <br />
          Please migrate all your elves one by one to successfully migrate them, earning you one Zen Elf every time you do it.
